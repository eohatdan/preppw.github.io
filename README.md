Prepare a text entry by entering a prefix.  A constant suffix will be added and the combined text string placed into the awaiting text entry field.

The preppw.html and exedit.html file work together.  Exedit.html allows exception to the default string to be created.  Preppw.html checks the exceptions list and uses any exceptions found there.  Otherwise, it generates the default string.

Local browser storage is used to share the exceptions list between exedit.html and preppw.html.

These apps work together to avoid the need to enter long strings with mixed alphanumeric characters.  Just type the prefix and the app generates the complete string and copies it into clipboard to be pasted into the awaiting text field.
